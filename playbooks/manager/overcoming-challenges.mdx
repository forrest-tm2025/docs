## Motivating Disengaged Employees

**Challenge:** \
Disengagement can manifest as decreased productivity, lack of enthusiasm, or a drop in team
morale. Often, the cause is a mismatch between an employee’s tasks and their intrinsic motivators.

**How MQi Helps:** \
MQi identifies the root causes of disengagement by analyzing the motivational profile of the
employee. Whether an employee values structure, autonomy, or recognition, MQi o􀆯ers insights
into how you can re-engage them by adjusting their responsibilities or communication style.

**Manager Prompt Example 1:** \
*"Sherpa, I’ve noticed that Laura’s performance has been slipping lately. Can you review her
MQi assessment and suggest how I can re-engage her based on her motivational profile?"*

**Manager Prompt Example 2:** \
*"Sherpa, Peter has seemed disconnected in meetings recently. Based on his MQi data, what
changes could I make to his workload or approach to reignite his enthusiasm?"*

## Addressing Conflict in Teams

**Challenge:** \
Conflicts within a team can often arise from di􀆯erences in work styles or underlying motivational
drivers. Left unchecked, these conflicts can disrupt productivity and erode team cohesion.

**How MQi Helps:** \
By understanding the individual motivators of each team member, MQi can reveal potential sources
of conflict. Sherpa can help you mediate and adjust team dynamics to balance motivational
mismatches and reduce friction.

**Manager Prompt Example 1:** \
*"Sherpa, we’ve been experiencing tension between Alex and Michelle. Can you analyze their
MQi profiles and suggest how I can resolve their di􀆯erences by addressing their individual
motivators?"*

**Manager Prompt Example 2:** \
*"Sherpa, the team’s collaboration seems to be declining. Based on the group’s collective
MQi profiles, are there any motivational clashes I should be aware of, and how can I adjust
to improve the situation?"*

## Navigating Change Management

**Challenge:** \
Organizational changes—whether restructuring, new initiatives, or changes in processes—can lead
to resistance, stress, or disengagement, especially if employees’ motivations aren’t aligned with the
changes.

**How MQi Helps:** \
MQi allows managers to predict how each employee is likely to respond to change based on their
motivational profiles. For example, those who value stability may need extra support during
transitions, while others motivated by challenge might thrive. Sherpa provides specific
recommendations to help guide employees through change in a way that resonates with their
motivations.

**Manager Prompt Example 1:** \
*"Sherpa, we’re about to implement a significant change in our workflow. How do you think
each team member will react based on their MQi profiles, and how can I tailor my
communication and support for each individual?"*

**Manager Prompt Example 2:** \
*"Sherpa, I know Lisa values structure and predictability. With the upcoming changes, how
can I provide her with the support she needs to feel comfortable and remain engaged?"*
