assessments. Here's how to interact with Sherpa:

    profile?"
3. **Receive Sherpa’s Response**
    * Sherpa will analyze the MQi data for Tom and provide tailored suggestions on how to
    re-engage him. These suggestions will include actionable steps, such as adjusting
    tasks or providing specific feedback.
4. **Follow-Up Prompts**
    * At the end of every Sherpa response, it will provide at least two or more sample
    follow-up prompts related to the original inquiry. These prompts are designed to
    help you dive deeper into the issue or explore related areas.

    queries into the dialogue box to receive specific advice.    

## Tips for Optimizing Sherpa Usage

1. **Use Specific Prompts:** When asking Sherpa for insights, be as specific as possible to
receive targeted recommendations. For example, *"How can I help Sarah improve her
leadership skills based on her MQi data?"* will yield more useful results than a general
inquiry.
2. **Follow-Up Prompts:** Don't hesitate to use Sherpa’s suggested follow-up prompts. These
will often lead you to new insights or deeper understanding of the issue you’re addressing.
3. **Regular Use:** Make a habit of checking in with Sherpa regularly—whether for weekly
performance reviews or specific management challenges. Sherpa is designed to help you
stay proactive in managing your team e􀆯ectively.

By following this step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to navigate the MQi platform with ease, leverage
Sherpa’s insights, and make data-driven decisions that enhance both your leadership and your
team’s performance. Remember, for ongoing support, reach out to your **MQi Advisor at TalentMotives, Inc.**,
